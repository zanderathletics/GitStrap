# GitStrap page configuration file.
This configuration file `Config` is used to setup this demo site. It is written
in Markdown and is parsed for options starting with the '`>`' character and
wrapped in a code block '<code>```</code>' for actual configuration options
([see the actual file for how this
looks](https://github.com/nckz/GitStrap/blob/gh-pages/Config)).

## Site Title
This title will show up on the left side of the navigation bar and on the
browser tab.

    Example: >My Favorite Website

This setup uses the following:

```
>Fitness by Alexander
```

<a name="pagesandnav"></a>
## Pages / Navigation
List your pages below in the order in which you'd like them to show up on your
website's navigation bar. Make sure each item is separated by a space. These
pages must reflect an actual filename in the root/base directory, you can start
by editing these files or adding new ones -remember the filename is the same as
what shows up on the navigation tab.

    Example: >Home Contacts About

Use the keyword 'GSBLOG' to place the link for a blog index.

    Example: >Home Contacts GSBLOG About 

This setup uses the following:

```
>Home Services About Testimonials Contact
```

## Theme
Put the theme name or url from [bootswatch](https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/bootswatch/).

    Examples: >cerulean, >cosmo, >cyborg, >darkly, >flatly, >journal, >lumen,
        >paper, >readable, >sandstone, >simplex, >slate, >spacelab, >superhero,
        >united, and >yeti.

This setup uses the following:

```
>paper
```

## Header
A running header text can be specified in a file, if desired.  To turn off the
header text set this option to false.
    
    Example: >false

This setup uses the following:

```
>Header
```

## Footer
A running footer for each page.

    Example: >false

This setup uses the following:

```
>Footer
```

## Blog
If a blog is desired, the post files (stored in `/posts/` directory) will be
included in the same way as navigation items.  Include the desired blog entires
by adding them to the list.  If a blog is desired, make sure to set the
`GSBLOG` keyword in the Nav item list above. The blog index link is named by
the first element in the post list:

    Example: >Index post1 post2 post3 post4

Where "Index" would be the blog index link name. This setup uses the following
(where "More" is the blog link and each blog file is listed on a new line):
```
>More 
Using-The-Blog 
GitStrap-Dependencies 
The-Index-File 
Using-GitStrap-With-GitLab
```

## Code
GitStrap uses the google-prettify project for code syntax highlighting. You can
choose themes from
[google](https://github.com/google/code-prettify/tree/9c3730f40994018a8ca9b786b088826b60d7b54a/styles)
or
[jmblog](https://github.com/jmblog/color-themes-for-google-code-prettify/tree/be5aa6fee61ad73f5a34ffb65099c8d1b3917602/dist/themes)
. Some examples of valid themes are:

    Examples: >desert, >doxy, >sons-of-obsidian, >sunburst, >tomorrow,
              >tomorrow-night, >tomorrow-night-blue, >tomorrow-night-bright,
              >tomorrow-night-eighties, >atelier-cave-dark,
              >atelier-sulphurpool-dark, >atelier-cave-light, >github, and
              >github-v2.

You can also use a url that points to a specific css file. This setup uses
the following:

```
>tomorrow
```
