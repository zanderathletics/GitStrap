## What I do

I took an interest in the human body in early high school. Having played
baseball and soccer my whole life, sports were always an everyday activity. I
attended Arizona State University and attained my bachelor of science in
Kinesiology. Kinesiology is the study of the human body and how it moves. All
of my primary classes had emphasis on sports biomechanics, fuel metabolism,
exercise endocrinology, sport psychology, and exercise physiology. I am
certified by the American Council on Exercise and have been in the fitness
industry for 8 years. I competed in my first bodybuilding show at 19 years old!

## Why I do it

My passion in life is to help others! I will work with you to evaluate your
lifestyle needs, training preferences and budget considerations!
